# A.C.R.O.N.Y.M.
ChatGPT-enhanced Technical Paper Acronym Generator Tool

#### Purpose:
Everyone loves clean acronym titles for their research papers. This tools allows you to use an already existing GPT API key and some under-the-hood NLP/prompt engineering to generate relevant acronyms for your paper.
The tool accepts your paper's abstract (or any type of generalized overview text) as input and outputs a user-specified number of acronyms and their associated titles.

#### What does A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. stand for?
ACRONYM stands for <b><i>A</i></b>utonomous <b><i>C</i></b>ontext-aware <b><i>R</i></b>efactoring <b><i>O</i></b>f the <b><i>N</i></b>ame for <b><i>Y</i></b>our <b><i>M</i></b>aterial. It is only fitting that for a project of this nature it has a clever acronym as a title.
> I came up with this name in the middle of the development process so no, the tool didn't generate it.

#### Usage:
I feel like the usage is pretty straight forward. Each field has tooltips referencing what they are responsible for and can be filled out with the user's desired setup.
- API Key: User's GPT API Key to access GPT models
- GPT Model: Model to use for query
- Prompt Size: Max number of tokens to use within query (1300 is usually enough)
- Number of Acronyms: # of acronyms to generate based off of input text
- Abstract: Your paper's abstract to use as source material
- A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. Output: Where generated acronyms will end up

#### Example Query (coming soon...):

Example output here

#### Future Work:
1. Refine prompt to allow for more obscure word usage and reduce chance of invalid titles
2. Refine synonym supplementation
3. Reformat output so titles are correctly capitalized
4. UI beautification
